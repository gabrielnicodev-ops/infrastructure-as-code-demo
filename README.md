## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **DevOps lifecycle** implementation using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. It automatically provisions a server on AWS, configures the environment, and deploys a full-stack microservices application ("Cloud Pulse") that monitors the server's real-time status.

The entire process—from zero to a running application—is orchestrated by a single bash script, ensuring **idempotency** and **reproducibility**.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

1.  **Provisioning (Terraform):**
    * Deploys an AWS EC2 instance (Free Tier eligible in `us-east-1`).
    * Dynamically fetches the latest Ubuntu AMI.
    * Configures Security Groups (Firewall) to strictly allow SSH (22), HTTP (80), and API (8080) traffic.
    * Manages SSH Key Pairs for secure access.

2.  **Configuration Management (Ansible):**
    * Connects via SSH to the newly created instance.
    * Installs Docker Engine, Docker Compose, and Git.
    * Secures user permissions.

3.  **Application Deployment (Docker Compose):**
    * **Backend (Go):** A lightweight API that retrieves system hostname and server time.
    * **Frontend (React + Vite):** A modern dashboard that consumes the API and displays the server's "pulse" in real-time.
    * **Orchestration:** Both services run in isolated containers connected via a bridge network.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed.
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) installed.
* An AWS Account with `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` configured.

### One-Click Deployment
I have created a master automation script that handles the entire workflow.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:gabrielnicodev-ops/infrastructure-as-code-demo.git
    cd infrastructure-as-code-demo
    ```

2.  **Run the deployment script:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x deploy.sh
    ./deploy.sh
    ```

### What happens next?
The script will:
1.  Initialize and apply **Terraform** plans.
2.  Wait for the EC2 instance to be ready.
3.  Update the **Ansible** inventory with the new dynamic IP.
4.  Run the Ansible Playbook to install dependencies and deploy the app.
5.  Output the final URL (e.g., `http://54.x.x.x`) where you can view the dashboard.

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

* **Zero Hardcoding:** No IPs are hardcoded; they are dynamically fetched and injected into the inventory.
* **Least Privilege:** Security Groups only open necessary ports.
* **Immutable Infrastructure:** The server can be destroyed and recreated identically at any time.
* **Optimized Builds:** Dockerfiles use multi-stage builds to keep images lightweight (Alpine Linux based).
